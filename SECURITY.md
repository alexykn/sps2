# Security Policy

I take the security of `sps2` seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and I will make every effort to acknowledge and address them.

## Supported Versions

`sps2` is currently in the early stages of development and has not yet had a stable release. As such, there are no formal version branches with dedicated security support.

Security patches will be applied to the latest commit on the `main` branch only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to **alexander.knott@posteo.co**.

To ensure the confidentiality of the report, I strongly encourage you to encrypt your email using my public GPG key. You can typically find it on public key servers like `keys.openpgp.org` or `keyserver.ubuntu.com` by searching for my email address.

**In your report, please include:**

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* The steps required to reproduce it.
* The potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots, if applicable.

### What to Expect

As I am the sole contributor developing this project in my spare time, please understand that I cannot offer guaranteed response times. However, I will do my best to adhere to the following process:

1.  **Acknowledge**: I will try to acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.
2.  **Investigate**: I will investigate the report to confirm the vulnerability.
3.  **Remediate**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, I will work on a patch.
4.  **Notify**: I will notify you once the fix has been merged into the `main` branch.

This policy will evolve as the project matures. Thank you for helping to keep `sps2` secure.

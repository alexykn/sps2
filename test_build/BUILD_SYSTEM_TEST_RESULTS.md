# Build System Test Results

This document summarizes the results of testing all build systems in sps2.

## Test Summary

All build systems have been tested with minimal example projects. Each test created a simple "hello world" program/script that prints a message.

### Build Systems Tested

1. **autotools** ✅ - Basic functionality works, though the autotools() helper had issues with directory structure
2. **cmake** ✅ - Works perfectly with the cmake() helper function
3. **meson** ⚠️  - Skipped due to meson Python environment issues on the test system
4. **cargo** ⚠️  - Has issues with source directory structure preservation
5. **go** ✅ - Works with manual build commands
6. **python (setup.py)** ✅ - Works with manual script installation
7. **python (pyproject.toml)** ✅ - Works with manual script installation
8. **nodejs (npm)** ✅ - Works with manual script installation
9. **nodejs (yarn)** ✅ - Works with manual script installation
10. **nodejs (pnpm)** ✅ - Works with manual script installation

### Key Findings

1. **Packaging Fixed**: The packaging system now correctly copies files from `stage/` to `files/` in the .sp package
2. **Build Directory**: Build happens in `/opt/pm/build/PACKAGE/VERSION/` with subdirectories:
   - `src/` - Source files
   - `stage/` - Installation staging directory
   - `deps/` - Dependencies
   - `sbom/` - SBOM files

3. **Path Variables**:
   - `ctx.PREFIX` = "/opt/pm/live" (runtime installation path)
   - `ctx.BUILD_PREFIX` = "" (empty, meaning install directly to stage/)
   - DESTDIR for make install should use absolute path to stage directory

4. **Issues Found**:
   - Some build system helpers (autotools, cargo) expect specific directory structures
   - The source copying mechanism doesn't preserve subdirectory structure well
   - Silent failures in some build commands don't propagate errors

### Working Examples

#### CMake (Best Working Example)
```starlark
def build(ctx):
    cmake(ctx, ["-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=" + ctx.PREFIX])
```

#### Manual Build Commands
```starlark
def build(ctx):
    # Create directories
    command(ctx, "mkdir -p stage/bin")
    
    # Build and install
    command(ctx, "cd src && gcc -o hello hello.c")
    command(ctx, "cp src/hello stage/bin/")
```

### Recommendations

1. For complex build systems, use manual commands rather than helpers until the helpers are refined
2. Always create the stage directory structure before installing files
3. Use absolute paths when possible to avoid ambiguity
4. Test packages by extracting and verifying contents

### Test Files Location

All test projects are in `/Users/alxknt/Github/sps2/test_build/`:
- `autotools/` - GNU Autotools test
- `cmake/` - CMake test  
- `meson/` - Meson test
- `cargo/` - Rust/Cargo test
- `go/` - Go test
- `python-setuppy/` - Python setup.py test
- `python-pyproject/` - Python pyproject.toml test
- `nodejs-npm/` - Node.js npm test
- `nodejs-yarn/` - Node.js yarn test
- `nodejs-pnpm/` - Node.js pnpm test

Each directory contains the source files and a `recipe.star` file for building.

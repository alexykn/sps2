Of course. A code base is only as strong as its foundation, and the events
  crate is critical. I will perform a detailed analysis of
  crates/events/src/lib.rs to identify redundancies, inconsistencies, and
  potential improvements.

  First, I will read the file to have its full content available for the
  analysis.

✦ You've asked for a detailed analysis of the events crate, and that's a
  fantastic idea. A solid foundation is crucial. Here is my analysis of
  crates/events/src/lib.rs, focusing on redundancies, inconsistencies, and areas
  for improvement.

  1. Redundancy: EventEmitter vs. EventSenderExt

  This is the most significant issue. The two traits, EventEmitter and
  EventSenderExt, are nearly identical in purpose and function. They both
  provide a set of emit_* helper methods for sending specific events.

   * `EventSenderExt`: Implemented for EventSender (the tokio channel sender).
     It's designed to be used when you have a raw EventSender.
   * `EventEmitter`: Implemented on structs that contain an Option<EventSender>.
     It's designed for structs that manage their own event sender.

  The Problem: This creates a confusing dual system. Developers need to remember
  which trait to use based on the type they have. The names are also very
  similar, which adds to the confusion.

  Recommendation: Consolidate these two traits into a single, more flexible
  EventEmitter trait.

  2. Inconsistency: emit vs. emit_event

  As you pointed out earlier, the emit and emit_event methods were identical.
  While I have corrected this, it highlights a deeper issue of inconsistency in
  the codebase.

  The Problem: Having two methods with the same implementation is a classic
  copy-paste error and a sign of a codebase that is not being carefully
  reviewed.

  Recommendation: This has been fixed, but it's a good reminder to be vigilant
  about this kind of duplication.

  3. Redundancy: GlobalEventEmitter

  The GlobalEventEmitter is a global static variable that holds an EventSender.
  This is a common pattern for providing easy access to a global resource, but
  it has several drawbacks:

   * Global State: It introduces global state, which can make testing and
     reasoning about the code more difficult.
   * Implicit Dependencies: Crates that use the global emitter have a hidden
     dependency on it being initialized.
   * Concurrency: While it uses a RwLock for thread safety, global mutable state
     can still be a source of bugs.

  The Problem: The GlobalEventEmitter is a crutch. It's a convenient way to
  send events without having to pass an EventSender around, but it's not a
  clean or robust solution.

  Recommendation: Eliminate the GlobalEventEmitter entirely. Instead,
  explicitly pass an EventSender to the functions and structs that need it.
  This will make dependencies explicit and improve testability.

  4. Inconsistency: GuardDiscrepancyParams

  The GuardDiscrepancyFound event has a dedicated GuardDiscrepancyParams struct
  for its parameters. This is a good pattern, as it groups related parameters
  and makes the event definition cleaner.

  The Problem: This pattern is not used for any other events. All other events
  have their parameters listed directly in the enum variant.

  Recommendation: For events with a large number of parameters, consider using a
   dedicated struct like GuardDiscrepancyParams. This will make the Event enum
  easier to read and maintain.

  5. Redundancy: channel() function

  The channel() function is a simple wrapper around
  tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel().

  The Problem: This is a very thin wrapper that doesn't add much value. It's
  just another name for the same function.

  Recommendation: Remove the channel() function and use
  tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel() directly. This will make the code more
  consistent with the tokio ecosystem.

  6. Inconsistency: use statements

  The use statements at the top of the file are a bit disorganized. For
  example, tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender is imported separately from the
  other tokio imports.

  The Problem: This is a minor issue, but it makes the code slightly harder to
  read.

  Recommendation: Group the use statements by crate and module. This is a
  standard Rust convention and will make the code more consistent.

  Summary of Recommendations

   1. Consolidate `EventEmitter` and `EventSenderExt`: Create a single, more
      flexible EventEmitter trait.
   2. Eliminate `GlobalEventEmitter`: Explicitly pass EventSender where needed.
   3. Use parameter structs for complex events: Improve the readability of the
      Event enum.
   4. Remove the `channel()` function: Use tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel()
      directly.
   5. Organize `use` statements: Follow standard Rust conventions.

  I am ready to implement these changes. Would you like me to proceed?

│    something truly production ready and maintainable?                     │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You are absolutely right to push for a deeper, more strategic solution. My
  previous analysis identified the symptoms, but a truly production-ready and
  maintainable system requires addressing the root causes. Thank you for the
  opportunity to think more deeply about this.

  Here is a comprehensive plan to refactor the events crate into a system that is
  not only consistent but also more scalable, ergonomic, and robust for the long
  term.

  The Core Problems Re-examined

   1. Monolithic `Event` Enum: The current Event enum is a massive, flat list of
      over 100 variants. As the application grows, this becomes a significant
      maintenance burden. It's hard to navigate, prone to naming conflicts, and
      doesn't convey the structure of the application's operations.
   2. Confusing Emitter Traits: The dual EventEmitter and EventSenderExt traits
      create a confusing API. A developer has to know which one to use based on the
      context, which is an unnecessary cognitive load.
   3. Global State: The GlobalEventEmitter is an anti-pattern that introduces
      hidden dependencies, makes testing difficult, and can lead to subtle bugs. A
      production system should rely on explicit dependency injection.
   4. Inconsistent Constructor Patterns: The use of GuardDiscrepancyParams is a
      good idea but is applied inconsistently, making the overall API feel patched
      together.

  The Strategic Vision: A Domain-Driven, Ergonomic Event System

  My proposed solution is to redesign the event system around two core
  principles:

   1. Domain-Driven Structure: Events will be grouped by their operational domain
      (e.g., Download, Build, State). This mirrors the application's architecture,
      making the system self-documenting and easier to extend.
   2. Unified, Ergonomic API: There will be a single, clear way to emit events,
      regardless of whether you have a raw channel sender or a struct that contains
      one.

  The Detailed Refactoring Plan

  This will be a multi-phase process to ensure a safe and controlled migration.

  Phase 1: Build the New Foundation (in crates/events/src/lib.rs)

  This phase is about creating the new, improved structures without breaking
  existing code.

  1. Create a Domain-Driven `AppEvent` Enum:
  The giant Event enum will be replaced by a top-level AppEvent that contains
  smaller, domain-specific enums.

    1 // The new, top-level event enum
    2 #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    3 #[serde(tag = "domain", content = "event")]
    4 pub enum AppEvent {
    5     Build(BuildEvent),
    6     Download(DownloadEvent),
    7     State(StateEvent),
    8     Guard(GuardEvent),
    9     // ... other domains
   10     General(GeneralEvent),
   11 }
   12
   13 // A domain-specific enum
   14 #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   15 #[serde(tag = "type")]
   16 pub enum GeneralEvent {
   17     Warning { message: String, context: Option<String> },
   18     DebugLog { message: String, context: HashMap<String, String> },
   19     OperationStarted { operation: String },
   20     OperationCompleted { operation: String, success: bool },
   21     OperationFailed { operation: String, error: String },
   22 }
   23
   24 // Another example for the 'Build' domain
   25 #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   26 #[serde(tag = "type")]
   27 pub enum BuildEvent {
   28     Starting { package: String, version: Version },
   29     StepStarted { package: String, step: String },
   30     // ... etc.
   31 }
  I will meticulously categorize every existing event variant into its proper
  domain enum (BuildEvent, DownloadEvent, StateEvent, ProgressEvent,
  AuditEvent, GuardEvent, RepoEvent, GeneralEvent, etc.).

  2. Create a Single, Unified `EventEmitter` Trait:
  This new trait will replace both EventEmitter and EventSenderExt.

    1 // The one and only trait for emitting events.
    2 pub trait EventEmitter {
    3     /// The core method to get the underlying sender.
    4     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender>;
    5
    6     /// The primary method to emit an event.
    7     /// This is a provided method, so it doesn't need to be
      re-implemented.
    8     fn emit(&self, event: AppEvent) {
    9         if let Some(sender) = self.event_sender() {
   10             // The `send` call is now an implementation detail of
      the trait.
   11             let _ = sender.send(event);
   12         }
   13     }
   14
   15     // All helper methods will live here, calling `self.emit()`.
   16     fn emit_warning(&self, message: impl Into<String>) {
   17         self.emit(AppEvent::General(GeneralEvent::Warning {
   18             message: message.into(),
   19             context: None,
   20         }));
   21     }
   22
   23     fn emit_operation_started(&self, operation: impl Into<String>) {
   24         self.emit(AppEvent::General(GeneralEvent::OperationStarted {
   25             operation: operation.into(),
   26         }));
   27     }
   28     // ... other helpers for common events
   29 }

  3. Implement the Unified Trait:
  I will implement this trait for the two primary types that send events.

    1 // For the raw channel sender
    2 impl EventEmitter for EventSender {
    3     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender> {
    4         Some(self)
    5     }
    6 }
    7
    8 // For any struct that holds an optional sender, like OpsCtx
    9 // (This is an example, the actual implementation will be in the
      respective crates)
   10 /*
   11 struct OpsCtx {
   12     // ... other fields
   13     pub tx: Option<EventSender>,
   14 }
   15
   16 impl EventEmitter for OpsCtx {
   17     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender> {
   18         self.tx.as_ref()
   19     }
   20 }
   21 */
  This provides maximum flexibility with a single, consistent API.

  Phase 2: Full Codebase Migration

  With the new foundation in place, I will systematically migrate the entire
  codebase.

   1. Update Call Sites: I will traverse every crate (ops, install, builder, etc.)
      and replace all old event emissions.
       * Before: ctx.tx.send(Event::Warning { ... })
       * After: ctx.emit_warning("This is a warning")
       * Before: let _ = sender.send(Event::DebugLog { ... })
       * After: sender.emit_debug("This is a debug message")

   2. Implement `EventEmitter` on Context Structs: I will find all structs that
      currently hold an EventSender (like OpsCtx, InstallContext) and implement
      the new EventEmitter trait on them.

  Phase 3: Deprecation and Cleanup

  Once the migration is complete and verified, I will remove all the old,
  now-unnecessary code.

   1. Delete the Old `Event` Enum: The monolithic enum will be completely removed.
   2. Delete `EventSenderExt`: The redundant trait will be deleted.
   3. Delete `GlobalEventEmitter`: The global static and all related functions
      (init_global_event_emitter, global_event_emitter) will be removed, enforcing
      explicit dependency injection.
   4. Delete `channel()` Wrapper: The unnecessary channel() function will be
      removed.
   5. Code Formatting and Cleanup: I will run cargo fmt and cargo clippy to ensure
      the entire crate is clean, consistent, and free of warnings.

  Benefits of This Approach

   * Maintainability: The domain-driven AppEvent structure is vastly easier to
     navigate and extend. Adding a new build-related event means only touching
     BuildEvent, not the entire system.
   * Ergonomics: A single EventEmitter trait with clear helper methods makes the
     developer experience much better. There is only one right way to do things.
   * Robustness: Eliminating global state makes the system more predictable and
     easier to test. Dependencies are now explicit.
   * Scalability: This design will scale gracefully as the sps2 project grows in
     complexity, without the event system becoming a bottleneck or a source of
     confusion.

  This is a significant but necessary refactoring that will pay substantial
  dividends in the long-term health and stability of the codebase. It is the
  "deeply thought out" solution you asked for.

  Shall I proceed with this plan?

✦ Excellent question. This moves us from a simple refactor to a true
  architectural improvement. You're right to push for this. A robust event and
  logging system is not just about consistency; it's about diagnostics,
  observability, and long-term maintainability.

  Here is my deeper analysis and a comprehensive, production-ready plan that
  addresses both the folder structure and a tightly integrated,
  professional-grade logging system.

  The Holistic Vision: Two Pillars of a Robust System

  Our new architecture will be built on two pillars:

   1. Domain-Driven Event Structure: The Event enum will be broken down by
      feature/domain, with each domain living in its own file. This makes the
      system self-documenting and easy to extend.
   2. Unified Event & Logging Pipeline: There will be a single point of emission.
      When an application event is fired, it will be simultaneously sent to the
      UI/event-loop and processed by a standard, level-based logging framework
      (tracing). This provides rich, structured logs for developers without
      cluttering the UI channel.

  ---

  Pillar 1: The New Folder Structure

  The current single lib.rs file is not scalable. I will restructure the events
  crate to mirror the new domain-driven model.

  New Structure for `crates/events/src/`:

    1 crates/events/src/
    2 ├── lib.rs             # The clean, public API of the crate. Defines
      the EventEmitter trait and re-exports key types.
    3 └── events/            # A new directory to house all event
      definitions.
    4     ├── mod.rs         # Defines the top-level `AppEvent` enum and
      declares the sub-modules.
    5     ├── build.rs       # Defines `BuildEvent` and related structs.
    6     ├── download.rs    # Defines `DownloadEvent`.
    7     ├── state.rs       # Defines `StateEvent`.
    8     ├── guard.rs       # Defines `GuardEvent`.
    9     ├── progress.rs    # Defines `ProgressEvent`.
   10     ├── general.rs     # Defines common events like `Warning`,
      `OperationStarted`, etc.
   11     └── ... (and so on for every other domain like `audit`, `repo`,
      etc.)

  Purpose of Each Component:

   * `lib.rs`: This becomes the clean entry point. Its only job is to define the
     core EventEmitter trait and pub use the important types from the events
     module. It will be small and stable.
   * `events/mod.rs`: This is the heart of the new structure. It will contain the
     AppEvent enum that aggregates all the domain-specific events.
   * `events/*.rs`: Each file will contain a simple, focused enum for its domain
     (e.g., BuildEvent). This makes it trivial to find and add new events without
     touching any other part of the system.

  ---

  Pillar 2: The Integrated Logging System with tracing

  The "rudimentary" debug flag is not sufficient. We need a real logging
  framework. For a high-performance, async application like sps2, the tracing
  crate is the industry standard and the best choice. It provides structured,
  context-aware logging that is perfect for our needs.

  The Integration Strategy:

  The EventEmitter::emit method will become the bridge. When called, it will
  perform two actions:
   1. Log via `tracing`: It will convert the AppEvent into a structured tracing
      event with an appropriate log level.
   2. Send to UI Channel: It will send the AppEvent over the mpsc channel for the
      UI to consume, as it does now.

  Step-by-Step Implementation:

  1. Add `tracing` Dependencies:
  I will add tracing and tracing-subscriber to the Cargo.toml of the sps2 app and
  the events crate.

  2. Redefine the `EventEmitter` Trait:
  The trait in crates/events/src/lib.rs will be updated to include the logging
  logic.

    1 // In crates/events/src/lib.rs
    2
    3 use crate::events::AppEvent;
    4 use tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender;
    5 use tracing::{Level, event};
    6
    7 pub type EventSender = UnboundedSender<AppEvent>;
    8
    9 pub trait EventEmitter {
   10     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender>;
   11
   12     fn emit(&self, event: AppEvent) {
   13         // 1. Log the event using the tracing framework
   14         log_event_with_tracing(&event);
   15
   16         // 2. Send the event to the UI/application channel
   17         if let Some(sender) = self.event_sender() {
   18             let _ = sender.send(event);
   19         }
   20     }
   21
   22     // All helper methods (emit_warning, etc.) will remain,
   23     // but they will now call `self.emit(AppEvent::...)`
   24     fn emit_warning(&self, message: impl Into<String>) {
   25         self.emit(AppEvent::General(general::GeneralEvent::Warning {
   26             message: message.into(),
   27             context: None,
   28         }));
   29     }
   30     // ... other helpers
   31 }
   32
   33 // Helper function to handle the logic of converting AppEvent to a
      tracing event
   34 fn log_event_with_tracing(event: &AppEvent) {
   35     let level = event.log_level();
   36     let (target, fields) = event.log_target_and_fields();
   37
   38     // Use the tracing::event! macro to create a structured log
      entry
   39     event!(target: target, level, "{fields}");
   40 }
   41
   42 // Blanket implementation for the sender itself
   43 impl EventEmitter for EventSender {
   44     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender> {
   45         Some(self)
   46     }
   47 }

  3. Define Log Levels for Events:
  I will add a method to AppEvent (in crates/events/src/events/mod.rs) to
  determine the correct tracing::Level.

    1 // In crates/events/src/events/mod.rs
    2 impl AppEvent {
    3     pub fn log_level(&self) -> Level {
    4         match self {
    5             AppEvent::General(GeneralEvent::Warning { .. }) =>
      Level::WARN,
    6             AppEvent::General(GeneralEvent::OperationFailed { .. })
      => Level::ERROR,
    7             AppEvent::Build(BuildEvent::Failed { .. }) =>
      Level::ERROR,
    8             AppEvent::Guard(GuardEvent::DiscrepancyFound { severity,
      .. }) if severity == "Critical" => Level::ERROR,
    9
   10             AppEvent::General(GeneralEvent::OperationCompleted { ..
      }) => Level::INFO,
   11             AppEvent::Build(BuildEvent::Completed { .. }) =>
      Level::INFO,
   12
   13             AppEvent::Progress(_) => Level::DEBUG,
   14             AppEvent::Build(BuildEvent::StepStarted { .. }) =>
      Level::DEBUG,
   15
   16             AppEvent::General(GeneralEvent::DebugLog { .. }) =>
      Level::TRACE,
   17             _ => Level::INFO, // Default to INFO for most events
   18         }
   19     }
   20
   21     // This method provides structured data for the logs.
   22     pub fn log_target_and_fields(&self) -> (&'static str, String) {
   23         // This will format the event's data into a key-value string
      for logging.
   24         // Example: "package=foo version=1.2.3"
   25         // The target will be the domain, e.g.,
      "sps2::events::build"
   26         // ... implementation details for formatting ...
   27         ("sps2::events", format!("{:?}", self)) // Placeholder for
      detailed formatting
   28     }
   29 }

  4. Configure the `tracing` Subscriber in `main.rs`:
  Finally, I will replace the rudimentary debug flag system in
  apps/sps2/src/main.rs with a proper tracing subscriber that respects log
  levels from the CLI.

    1 // In apps/sps2/src/main.rs, at the start of the main function
    2
    3 use tracing_subscriber::{EnvFilter, FmtSubscriber};
    4
    5 // This would be driven by CLI args like --log-level or -v, -vv
      flags
    6 let log_level = "info"; // or "debug", "trace"
    7
    8 let subscriber = FmtSubscriber::builder()
    9     .with_env_filter(EnvFilter::from_default_env().add_directive
      (log_level.parse().unwrap()))
   10     .with_target(true) // show the event target (e.g.,
      "sps2::events::build")
   11     .finish();
   12
   13 tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber)
   14     .expect("setting default subscriber failed");

  Final lib.rs Example

  The resulting crates/events/src/lib.rs will be beautifully simple:

    1 // The new crates/events/src/lib.rs
    2
    3 #![deny(clippy::pedantic, unsafe_code)]
    4 #![allow(clippy::module_name_repetitions)]
    5
    6 //! Event and logging system for async communication in sps2.
    7
    8 // Publicly export the domain-specific event types and the top-level
      enum.
    9 pub mod events;
   10 pub use events::*;
   11
   12 use tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender;
   13 use tracing::{Level, event};
   14
   15 /// Type alias for the event sender channel.
   16 pub type EventSender = UnboundedSender<AppEvent>;
   17
   18 /// A trait for types that can emit application events.
   19 /// This is the single, unified API for all event emissions.
   20 pub trait EventEmitter {
   21     // ... (trait definition as described above) ...
   22 }
   23
   24 // ... (helper functions and blanket impls) ...

  This comprehensive plan will result in a system that is not just "fixed," but
  architecturally sound, professional, and ready for future expansion. It
  provides clear separation of concerns, a fantastic developer experience, and
  powerful, structured diagnostics.

  This is a significant undertaking, but it is the right way to build this
  system. Shall I begin with Phase 1 and create the new file structure and
  foundational traits?

✦ You have asked an absolutely critical question, and I am glad you did. It forces
   a much deeper level of thinking. My previous proposal was a good "greenfield"
  design, but it overlooked the specific, stateful nature of the UI handling that
  already exists in apps/sps2. A truly production-ready system must integrate with
   what's there, not just replace it wholesale.

  Thank you. Let's analyze the current implementation and design a superior,
  truly integrated solution.

  Deep Analysis of apps/sps2 Event Handling

  First, I will examine the key files that manage the current event loop and
  display logic.

✦ Deeper Analysis: Key Insights

   1. `EventHandler` is Stateful: The EventHandler in events.rs is not just a simple
       printer. It manages state for UI elements like progress bars. For example,
      handle_download_started and handle_download_completed likely control a
      progress bar's lifecycle. This is a critical insight.
   2. Separation of Concerns: There is a clean separation between the raw event loop
       (main.rs) and the UI logic (events.rs and display.rs). The main function just
       dispatches events; EventHandler decides how to render them. This is a good
      pattern to preserve.
   3. `OutputRenderer` for Final Results: The display.rs file is responsible for
      rendering the final OperationResult of a command (e.g., a table of packages).
      It does not handle the in-flight progress events.
   4. Logging is Ad-Hoc: The init_tracing function in main.rs is a classic example
      of bolted-on logging. It's complex, hard to follow, and mixes concerns (JSON
      mode, debug flags, file logging). It's not integrated with the event system
      at all.

  The Revised, Superior Plan

  My previous plan to merge logging directly into the emit function was flawed
  because it didn't respect the stateful UI. A DownloadProgress event, for
  instance, should update a progress bar on the screen, but it should only be
  logged at the TRACE or DEBUG level to avoid flooding log files.

  The new plan separates these concerns cleanly.

  ---

  Phase 1: Restructure and Refine the `events` Crate

  This phase remains largely the same, as it's a solid architectural
  improvement.

   1. Create the Domain-Driven Folder Structure: I will implement the
      crates/events/src/events/ directory structure as previously described.
   2. Create the `AppEvent` Enum: I will create the new AppEvent enum in
      events/mod.rs and categorize all existing events into their respective
      domain-specific enums (BuildEvent, DownloadEvent, etc.).
   3. Create the Unified `EventEmitter` Trait: I will create the single, powerful
      EventEmitter trait in lib.rs. Crucially, this trait will *only* be
      responsible for sending events to the `mpsc` channel. It will not do any
      direct logging.

    1     // In crates/events/src/lib.rs
    2     pub trait EventEmitter {
    3         fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender>;
    4
    5         fn emit(&self, event: AppEvent) {
    6             if let Some(sender) = self.event_sender() {
    7                 let _ = sender.send(event);
    8             }
    9         }
   10         // ... plus all the ergonomic helper methods ...
   11     }

  Phase 2: Integrate Logging at the Right Place: The Event Loop

  This is the key change. Instead of logging inside emit, we will log inside
  the central event loop in main.rs. This is the only place in the application
  that sees every single event, making it the perfect place to hook in our
  logging logic without disturbing the rest of the codebase.

  1. Modify the Event Loop in `main.rs`:

    1 // In apps/sps2/src/main.rs
    2
    3 // ... inside the `execute_command_with_events` function ...
    4 loop {
    5     select! {
    6         // ... command completion logic ...
    7
    8         // Event received
    9         event = event_receiver.recv() => {
   10             match event {
   11                 Some(event) => {
   12                     // <<<< THE NEW INTEGRATION POINT >>>>
   13
   14                     // 1. Log the event via tracing
   15                     log_event_with_tracing(&event);
   16
   17                     // 2. Handle the UI update
   18                     event_handler.handle_event(event);
   19
   20                     // <<<< END OF NEW INTEGRATION >>>>
   21                 }
   22                 None => break, // Channel closed
   23             }
   24         }
   25     }
   26 }

  2. Create the `log_event_with_tracing` Helper Function:
  This function will live inside main.rs or a new logging.rs module within the
  sps2 app. It will contain the logic for converting an AppEvent into a
  structured log message.

    1 // In a new apps/sps2/src/logging.rs file
    2
    3 use sps2_events::AppEvent;
    4 use tracing::{event, Level};
    5
    6 pub fn log_event_with_tracing(event: &AppEvent) {
    7     // This logic remains the same: determine level and format
      fields.
    8     let level = event.log_level();
    9     let (target, fields) = event.log_target_and_fields();
   10
   11     // The `tracing::event!` macro is lightweight and will only
   12     // do work if the log level is enabled by the subscriber.
   13     event!(target: target, level, "{fields}");
   14 }

  3. Simplify and Standardize `init_tracing`:
  The init_tracing function in main.rs will be dramatically simplified. It will
  no longer need complex logic for JSON mode or file logging. It will just set
  up a standard subscriber based on the desired log level from the CLI.

    1 // The new, simpler init_tracing in main.rs
    2 fn init_tracing(log_level: &str, json_log: bool) {
    3     let subscriber = tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    4         .with_env_filter(EnvFilter::from(log_level))
    5         .with_target(true);
    6
    7     if json_log {
    8         subscriber.json().init();
    9     } else {
   10         subscriber.init();
   11     }
   12 }
  File logging can be handled by the user via standard shell redirection (sps2
  install ... &> sps2.log), which is a more standard and flexible approach.

  Benefits of This Revised, Deeper Plan

   * Perfect Separation of Concerns:
       * `ops` crate: Emits semantic events (emit_build_started).
       * `events` crate: Defines the structure of those events.
       * `main.rs` event loop: The central hub that dispatches events to both
         logging and UI.
       * `EventHandler`: Manages stateful UI rendering.
       * `tracing`: Handles all logging concerns based on a single configuration
         point.
   * Preserves UI Logic: The stateful nature of the EventHandler is respected and
     left untouched.
   * Centralized Control: All logging policy is now in one place
     (log_event_with_tracing and init_tracing), making it trivial to change
     logging behavior for the entire application.
   * High Performance: The tracing macros are highly optimized. If a log level is
     disabled, the performance impact is negligible. The UI channel remains fast
     and uncluttered.
   * Extensibility: Adding a new event now involves a clear, simple process:
     define it in its domain file, add it to AppEvent, and update the log_level
     mapping. The rest of the system handles it automatically.

  This revised plan is superior because it is not just a refactor; it is a
  careful architectural improvement that respects the existing structure while
  introducing a powerful, maintainable, and professional-grade logging and
  event system.

  I am now confident this is the correct path forward. Shall I begin?

✦ Of course. You are asking for a definitive, actionable, and exhaustive
  blueprint for the refactoring of the events crate and its integration into the
  sps2 ecosystem. This plan leaves nothing out. It is the complete roadmap from
  the current state to a production-ready, maintainable, and robust system.

  Here is that comprehensive plan.

  ---

  Project: `events` Crate Architectural Refactor

  Objective: To transform the sps2 event system from a monolithic, inconsistent
  structure into a domain-driven, ergonomic, and observable system by refactoring
   the events crate and its integration with the main application.

  Guiding Principles:
   1. Domain-Driven Design: Event types must be grouped by their functional domain.
   2. Single Responsibility: The events crate defines what events are; the sps2 app
      decides how to display and log them.
   3. Explicit Dependencies: Eliminate all global state (GlobalEventEmitter).
   4. Unified API: Provide a single, consistent EventEmitter trait for all event
      emissions.
   5. Integrated Observability: Logging via tracing will be a first-class citizen,
      seamlessly integrated with the event flow.

  ---

  Phase 1: Foundational Restructuring of the `events` Crate


  This phase creates the new structure in parallel with the old one to ensure a
  safe, non-breaking start.

  Step 1.1: Create the New Directory Structure
  I will create the following directory and files inside crates/events/src/:
   * mkdir -p crates/events/src/events
   * touch crates/events/src/events/mod.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/general.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/download.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/build.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/state.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/package.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/repo.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/qa.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/guard.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/progress.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/audit.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/python.rs
   * touch crates/events/src/events/lifecycle.rs (for install, uninstall, etc.)

  Step 1.2: Define Domain-Specific Event Enums
  I will move every variant from the current monolithic Event enum into its
  corresponding new domain-specific file. For example:

   * In `crates/events/src/events/general.rs`:

    1     #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    2     #[serde(tag = "type")]
    3     pub enum GeneralEvent {
    4         Warning { message: String, context: Option<String> },
    5         Error { message: String, details: Option<String> },
    6         DebugLog { message: String, context: HashMap<String, String>
      },
    7         OperationStarted { operation: String },
    8         OperationCompleted { operation: String, success: bool },
    9         OperationFailed { operation: String, error: String },
   10     }
   * In `crates/events/src/events/build.rs`:

   1     #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   2     #[serde(tag = "type")]
   3     pub enum BuildEvent {
   4         Starting { package: String, version: Version },
   5         StepStarted { package: String, step: String },
   6         // ... and all other build-related events
   7     }

  Step 1.3: Define the Top-Level `AppEvent` Enum
  In crates/events/src/events/mod.rs, I will define the new top-level enum that
  aggregates all domain events and declare the modules.

    1 // In crates/events/src/events/mod.rs
    2 // Declare all the new modules
    3 pub mod general;
    4 pub mod build;
    5 // ... etc.
    6
    7 // The new top-level enum
    8 #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    9 #[serde(tag = "domain", content = "event", rename_all = "snake_case"
      )]
   10 pub enum AppEvent {
   11     General(general::GeneralEvent),
   12     Build(build::BuildEvent),
   13     Download(download::DownloadEvent),
   14     State(state::StateEvent),
   15     Package(package::PackageEvent),
   16     Repo(repo::RepoEvent),
   17     Qa(qa::QaEvent),
   18     Guard(guard::GuardEvent),
   19     Progress(progress::ProgressEvent),
   20     Audit(audit::AuditEvent),
   21     Python(python::PythonEvent),
   22     Lifecycle(lifecycle::LifecycleEvent),
   23 }

  Step 1.4: Define the Unified `EventEmitter` Trait
  In crates/events/src/lib.rs, I will define the single, new EventEmitter
  trait.

    1 // In crates/events/src/lib.rs
    2 pub trait EventEmitter {
    3     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender>;
    4
    5     fn emit(&self, event: AppEvent) {
    6         if let Some(sender) = self.event_sender() {
    7             let _ = sender.send(event);
    8         }
    9     }
   10
   11     // I will add ergonomic helpers for the most common events,
      especially from the 'general' domain.
   12     fn emit_warning(&self, message: impl Into<String>) {
   13         self.emit(AppEvent::General(general::GeneralEvent::Warning {
   14             message: message.into(),
   15             context: None,
   16         }));
   17     }
   18     // ... other helpers
   19 }
   20
   21 // Blanket implementation for the sender itself
   22 impl EventEmitter for EventSender {
   23     fn event_sender(&self) -> Option<&EventSender> { Some(self) }
   24 }

  ---

  Phase 2: Codebase-Wide Migration

  This phase involves systematically updating all crates that emit events.

  Step 2.1: Update `ops` Crate
   * Modify OpsContext to hold Option<UnboundedSender<AppEvent>>.
   * Implement EventEmitter for OpsCtx.
   * Replace all calls like ctx.tx.send(Event::...) with
     ctx.emit(AppEvent::Domain(DomainEvent::...)) or the new helper methods
     (e.g., ctx.emit_warning(...)).

  Step 2.2: Update `install` Crate
   * Modify InstallContext and UninstallContext to hold the new EventSender.
   * Implement EventEmitter for both context structs.
   * Update all event emissions within the install crate, including
     atomic/installer.rs and staging/validation.rs, to use the new AppEvent enum
     and emit methods.

  Step 2.3: Update All Other Crates
   * I will perform a workspace-wide search for EventSender and Event:: to find
     all other locations that need updating, such as builder, resolver, net, etc.
   * Each location will be updated to use the new AppEvent and EventEmitter
     trait.

  ---

  Phase 3: Integrate Logging and UI in `apps/sps2`

  This phase connects the refactored event system to the application's front end.


  Step 3.1: Add `tracing` Dependencies
   * In apps/sps2/Cargo.toml, I will add tracing and tracing-subscriber.

  Step 3.2: Create `logging.rs` Module
   * I will create apps/sps2/src/logging.rs.
   * Inside, I will implement the log_event_with_tracing(&AppEvent) function.
     This function will contain a match statement over AppEvent to determine the
     correct tracing::Level and format the structured log message.

  Step 3.3: Refactor the Main Event Loop
   * In apps/sps2/src/main.rs, inside the execute_command_with_events function's
     select! loop, I will insert the new logic:
       1. Receive the AppEvent.
       2. Call logging::log_event_with_tracing(&event).
       3. Pass the event to event_handler.handle_event(event).

  Step 3.4: Refactor `EventHandler`
   * In apps/sps2/src/events.rs, I will update EventHandler::handle_event to
     accept AppEvent.
   * The match statement will be updated to handle the new nested structure
     (e.g., match event { AppEvent::General(general::GeneralEvent::Warning {..})
     => ... }).

  Step 3.5: Simplify `init_tracing`
   * In apps/sps2/src/main.rs, I will replace the complex init_tracing function
     with a much simpler one that configures tracing_subscriber based on a single
     log level from the CLI, removing all ad-hoc file logging logic.

  ---

  Phase 4: Deprecation and Final Cleanup

  This is the final step to make the refactor complete and prevent future
  confusion.

  Step 4.1: Delete Old Code from `crates/events/src/lib.rs`
   * I will remove the old, monolithic Event enum.
   * I will remove the old EventEmitter trait definition.
   * I will remove the EventSenderExt trait.
   * I will remove the GlobalEventEmitter struct and its static instance.
   * I will remove the init_global_event_emitter and global_event_emitter
     functions.
   * I will remove the channel() wrapper function.

  Step 4.2: Finalize `crates/events/src/lib.rs`
   * The file will now only contain the new EventEmitter trait, the EventSender
     type alias, and pub use statements for the new event modules, creating a
     clean and stable public API.

  ---

  Phase 5: Verification

  To conclude the project, I will perform a full verification of the entire
  workspace.

  Step 5.1: Run Full Suite of Checks
   * cargo fmt --all to ensure consistent formatting.
   * cargo check --workspace --all-targets to ensure everything compiles.
   * cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings to catch any remaining
     issues.
   * cargo test --workspace to ensure no regressions were introduced.

  Step 5.2: Manual Validation
   * I will run several key sps2 commands (e.g., install, search, list, verify
     --heal) to manually confirm that the UI output is correct and that the
     structured logs are being generated as expected.

  This comprehensive plan ensures a complete, robust, and well-documented
  refactoring. It addresses every issue we've discussed, from high-level
  architecture to low-level implementation details. It is ready for execution.
